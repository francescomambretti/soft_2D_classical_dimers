All files necessary to generate starting configurations

Config_Creator.ipynb
    notebook to generate the starting configurations at will (commented)
    reads: input.lattice.dat

config.<nameconfig>.(<nc>).<N_dimer>
the value within () is optional
each folder contains 2 files:
 - input.lattice.dat    --> generic data concerning simulation box
 - config.0             --> particle positions
related to configurations coded as follows:

<nameconfig>
	- equi  --> equilateral triangular lattice -  dimers all aligned along pi/2
    	- equi.random  -->  equilateral triangular lattice -  random dimers orientation
	- long.random --> elongated triangular lattice (height much larger than the base) -  random dimers orientation
	- middle.random  --> intermediate triangular lattice -  random dimers orientation	
	- optimized.a2  --> optimized triangular lattice (obtained via minimization methods) with dimers all aligned along alpha/2 
   	- optimized.a3  --> optimized triangular lattice (obtained via minimization methods) with dimers all aligned along 3*alpha/2  (vedi tesi o presentazione)
	- optimized.pi2  --> optimized triangular lattice (obtained via minimization methods) with dimers all aligned along pi/2 

<nc>        . distinguish between many configurations with the same features
<N_dimer>    . number of dimers in the configurations
