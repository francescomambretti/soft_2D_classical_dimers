Here you can find the optimal parameters to run Parallel Tempering simulations

Set_Parameters.ipynb
	notebook to generate the right parameters for the Parallel Tempering moves.
	you still have to set the parameters for the highest and lowest T by hand, the others are generated by
	interpolating according to the temperature simulated by each rank


Coefficients for the PT moves (different for each T):
Alpha.dat  		. move Rotate() 
Delta_<>.dat: <>= NULL	. move Move()
		= AR	. move Aspect_Ratio()
		= a	. move Angle()
		= b	. move Break()

Temperature.dat
temperatures list

In High_T folder there are files for higher temperature simulations (not used throughout the paper)
