At each steps the MC code attempts to perform $N$ single particle moves and $N/2$ dimer moves (i.e. moves which simultaneously modify the position of both the particles of a dimer). In particular:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the $N$ single particle moves are random displacements (translations) within a given maximum range of one of the two particles of a dimer, leaving the other fixed
    \item the $N/2$ dimer moves are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item random rigid displacement of a dimer, within a given range
        \item random rotation around the dimer center of mass
        \item cluster deformation: the relative distance of the two particles of a dimer from the barycenter is randomly reduced or increased along their joining line, within a given range
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
According to the standard Metropolis algorithm %\cite{Metropolis},
the acceptance probability for any of these moves, leading from a old configuration $\mathbf{R_{t-1}}$ to a new one $\mathbf{R_t}$, is $\min \left(1, \exp[\beta (U(\mathbf{R_{t-1}})-U(\mathbf{R_t})]\right)$ where $U$ is the potential energy, Eq.~\eqref{upot}, and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature.
